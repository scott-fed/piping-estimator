- Calculating quantities: ________%
- Creating estimate document: ________%

## Current Workflow & Tools

**Q10:** What software does he currently use for estimates?
- [ ] Excel spreadsheets
- [ ] QuickBooks
- [ ] Specialized estimating software: ________________
- [ ] CAD software: ________________
- [ ] Other: ________________

**Q11:** Does he have a materials pricing database?
- [ ] Yes (what format? CSV, Excel, software?)
- [ ] No (gets quotes from vendors each time)

**Q12:** What vendors does he typically buy from?
- [ ] McMaster-Carr
- [ ] Ferguson
- [ ] Grainger
- [ ] Local suppliers
- [ ] Other: ________________

## Output Requirements

**Q13:** What format does he need for the final estimate?
- [ ] Excel spreadsheet
- [ ] CSV file
- [ ] PDF proposal
- [ ] Word document
- [ ] Import into existing software (which one?)

**Q14:** What information must be included in the estimate?
- [ ] Bill of Materials (BOM)
- [ ] Material costs
- [ ] Labor hours
- [ ] Labor costs

- [ ] 95%+ (will spot-check, mostly trust it)
- [ ] 99%+ (needs near-perfect to use)

**Q16:** Would he prefer:
- [ ] Fully automated (tool generates BOM, he reviews quickly)
- [ ] AI-assisted (tool extracts specs, he validates before BOM)
- [ ] Hybrid (high-confidence items auto-accepted, low-confidence flagged)

**Q17:** What would be a dealbreaker (make him not use the tool)?
- Answer: ________________

## Business Impact

**Q18:** If this tool works as described (4 hours → 15 minutes), how would it impact his business?
- More estimates per month? (how many more?)
- Faster turnaround wins more contracts?
- Frees up time for other work?
- Other: ________________
